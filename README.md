## XMind Format Version Notice

The XMind file format used in this project is following the description provided in 
[https://github.com/xmindltd/xmind/wiki/XMindFileFormat](https://github.com/xmindltd/xmind/wiki/XMindFileFormat) . 
It seems to be out-dated as XMind now released XMind 8 and XMind ZEN version, 
however, the old opened format should be still available in these new versions.
XMind 7.x and XMind ZEN has been tested with free trail versions of them.
